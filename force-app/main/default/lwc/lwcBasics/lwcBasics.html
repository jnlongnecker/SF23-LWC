<!--
		Lightning Web Components (LWC)
		- Allows you to reuse markup and css and js associated with the markup
		- These bundles are called components
		- Restructure your understanding of how web pages are made with components!

		- Salesforce has many ready-made components for us to use:
			https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components
		- Lightning web components are lightweight (fast) and run natively in the browser
		- There are some features that only support aura currently (but not many)
			https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.get_started_supported_experiences
		- LWC are also open source, so you don't have to be running SF to use LWC

		- LWC are often used to make Single Page Applications (or SPA)
			- A web application that does NOT have to navigate you to multiple pages to complete
			- LWC achieve this through something called conditional rendering 
				- Choosing what to display based on criteria
		
		Component Bundle
		- Components live in a folder called the component bundle. 
		- This folder and it's bundled files have some naming requirements:
			- Must begin with a lowercase letter
			- Must contain only alphanumeric or underscore characters ([a-zA-Z_0-9])
			- Must be unique in the namespace
			- Can't include whitespace
			- Can't end in an underscore
			- Can't contain 2 consecutive underscores
			- Can't contain a hyphen
		- This boils down to: camelCase your names and don't use anything but letters

		- But wait, custom html elements MUST have a hyphen, right?
		- LWC framework will generate the name of the actual component using a formula:
			- namespace-component-name
			- This naming convention is called kebab-case
			- So essentially, we convert from camelCase to kebab-case and prepend the namespace
		- In platform LWC, our namespace is ALWAYS c
			- You can get a different namespace in a managed package, but otherwise it's always c
			- So, our components are going to look like this:
				- c-component-name
		- Component bundle files:
			- HTML : A normal HTML that starts with the <template> tag
			- JS : The code for the component and the component definition
			- Meta : A .js-meta.xml file that is used for Salesforce
			- OPTIONAL FILES:
				- CSS : Contains style declarations for the component
				- SVG : Contains a svg icon for the component to identify it in the Lightning App Builder
			- All of these files MUST HAVE the same name as the component bundle

    <!--
			A directive is a special attribute given by the LWC framework that allows us to give special functionality
			to the element it is attached to.

			This is TYPICALLY the template element, but some directives work without the template.

			The if:true directive will conditionally render the content inside it.
				- This actually inserts or removes the content from the DOM
			The if:false directive does the same as the if:true, but only if the value is falsey
			The lwc:if directive does the same as the if:true directive
			The lwc:ifelse must be connected with a lwc:if and will render the content if the first template is false
			The lwc:else is as the end of a lwc:if lwc:ifelse chain and renders the content if all above are false

		  - The if:true and if:false are not recommended to be used anymore as they may be deprecated in the future

    <template if:true={showHidden}>

    <!--
			- The for:each directive iterates over an array and stores each item in a variable named
				after the for:item text
			- We can then access the values of the item by using expressions an using the text in
				for:item like a variable
			- The key is going to uniquely identify a particular item in the list
				- Key must be unique
				- Key must be present for all direct children of the template
			- Not pictured here, but we can also access the index using for:index

			- The iterator:iteratorName directive also iterates over an array and stores each item in
				a variable called "iteratorName" that we define
			- We can access information about the iteration using properties on this variable:
				- .value : The value of the item
				- .first : True if this is the first item
				- .last : True if this is the last item
				- .index : Returns the index of the current item
