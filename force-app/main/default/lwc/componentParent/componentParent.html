    The Shadow DOM
        - Normally, in a webpage you have the DOM
        - You can access any element from any part of the DOM using DOM selection methods
            - document.querySelector()
        - This is a problem with our components because they may contain sensitive information
            - You don't want third-party tools to be able to access your component markup
        - So, the Shadow DOM is used to provide encapsulation for HTML/CSS

        - What is it?
            - A web technology that encapsulates a portion of the DOM in a shadow tree
        - Remember, the DOM structure is a tree
        - Consequences of the Shadow DOM:
            - CSS Styles stop cascading : Components can only style themselves or be styled by themselves
            - Elements in the shadow tree cannot be queried for from document
                - In order to query for elements in the shadow tree, use this.template.querySelector()
                - Even though we CAN query, we should use the lwc:ref directive instead
                - EX: lwc:ref="myElem"
                    - In JS: this.refs.myElem to get the element in your JS
            - Events that bubble and capture past the shadow boundary will change the target to match the scope
                - Called event retargeting
                - EX: I click on a child component
                    - The child has an onclick event handler
                    - The parent has an onclick event handler
                        - The event.target property in the child will be the element clicked
                        - The event.target property in the parent will be the child component
            - Elements passed via a slot bypass the shadow boundary

    Lightning Locker and Lightning Web Security
    - Lightning Locker is the default and the older version of security
        - Lightning Locker is a lot more restrictive than Lightning Web Security
    - Both run for all your LWC, so the process is automatic
    - LWS runs JavaScript in isolated environments they call JavaScript sandboxes
        - It's because of this that LWS is less restrictive
        - There is a JavaScript sandbox for each namespace
    - We can opt-into LWS by going to Setup > Session Settings and enabling LWS
    - THIS ONLY IS IN EFFECT ON CLIENT SIDE
        - ONLY DOES WEB SECURITY, NOT RECORD SECURITY
    - Let's do a quick comparison of major differences/similarities between the two
    - Full rundown: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.security_lwsec_locker_comparison

    - BOTH: Enforce JS in strict mode
    - BOTH: Block non-secure API requests
    - BOTH: Protect against attacks like XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
    - LWS: Doesn't need to wrap window, document and element global objects in secure wrappers
        - We can access these global objects directly
    - LWS: Can access content in iFrames
        - LL blocks content access in iFrames
    - LWS: Better performance because it doesn't need secure wrappers
    - LWS: Better support of third-party JS libraries
    - LWS: Can import modules from any namespace
        - LL can only import modules from the c and lightning namespaces
