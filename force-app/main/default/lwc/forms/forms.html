        Lightning Forms

        - 3 kinds
            - Lightning Record Form (lightning-record-form) : For both
            - Lightning Record Edit Form (lightning-record-edit-form) : For editing/created a record
            - Lightning Record View Form (lightning-record-view-form) : For viewing record details

        - These forms use the UI API to efficiently create and request data and cache the results
            - Caching the results means we have faster duplicate requests
        - Take in an object api name to work for a particular object
        - Take in a list of fields to display or a layout type (full or compact)
        - Fires the submit event when the form is submitted
        - Fires the success event when the form completes
        - Fires the error event when the form fails
