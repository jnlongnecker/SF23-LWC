    Dynamic Interactions
        - A way of communicating across an APP PAGE (only works for an app page currently)
        - Involves no subscription or LMS
        - Takes effort from both developers and admins

        - A developer configures the meta file for a component to work with Dynamic Interactions
        - Another component on the screen that has exposed properties can have values
            passed in from the Dynamic Interaction event
        - A Dynamic Interaction event is just a CustomEvent in a top-level component

        - To configure a component as a publisher for Dynamic Interactions:
            - <targetConfig>
            - This must have an <event> element
            - This <event> element must have a child <schema> element
            - This <schema> element defines the shape of the CustomEvent data
